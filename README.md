# Sequencer

This is my fourth (I believe?) attempt at a musical sequencer.
The original was called tone lotus, and I can't find where that may live. I think it was a rails app.
The second was called Music To Us, and I also can't find that one, which is probably a node app.
The third is called Tones, and that currently lives at tones.aaronik.com.

Why am I making another one? Because I'm not happy with those. The primary goals of this one are:

Visual appearance - it should be nice to look at.
Simplicity - it should be obvious how to use it.

#### Down the line

I think there's a possibility this could be combined with another app, called music-wheel in my github, ATTOW located at
https://www.musictheory.page/. The wheel in that app could be set to key and mode, and then the sequencer could play back
in that key and mode.
